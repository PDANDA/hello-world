A floating currency is really clever. It works like a shock absorber. And it works naturally, just by the changing patterns of who is buying and selling the Australian dollar.
When our economy is strong, lots of foreigners want to buy Australian things. They buy our exports, they want to buy shares in our companies, and they want to lend money to Australians.
To do that they have to have Aussie dollars. So they try to buy AUD on the currency markets. Lots of people trying to buy AUD makes the price go up. The price of Australian dollar is measured in US Dollars. So we see the Aussie dollar rise by a few US cents.
